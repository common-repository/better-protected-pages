== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I want to show some of my text and hide the rest. How?

Simply use the built in <!--more--> feature that wordpress provides. Everything before the "read more" will be shown
if you enable the "show excerpt" feature, everything after will be hidden. Simple yet powerful.
 
= A question that someone might have =

Does this make my pages more secure?

YES! However the security measures that are built into Wordpress are not changed. 
This plugin allows you to add a “Re-lock” button so that you can lock a protected page when you are leaving ... by default Wordpress leaves a page unlocked once you have entered your password EVEN IF you close the browser.
